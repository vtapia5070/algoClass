/*
BINARY SEARCH ARRAY
Think phone book example which is O(logn) or O(n^1.5) or logarithmic
*** Description

Given a sorted array and a value, determine if the value is in the array using the binary search (divide and conquer) method.

*** Exercises

Write a function that takes a sorted array and a value and returns the index of the value in the array. Return null if the value is not found in the array. What is the time complexity?

Extra credit: Implement the function both iteratively and recursively.
